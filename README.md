# MySQL-Learning

Welcome to my Anish's-MySQL Learning Repository!
<br>
Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts covering fundamental to advanced MySQL concepts. <br>I'm using XAMPP to set up a local MySQL environment, making it easy for you to follow along.

What you'll learn:

DDL (Data Definition Language): Create, modify, and delete database structures.<br>
DQL (Data Query Language): Retrieve data from databases using SELECT statements.<br>
DML (Data Manipulation Language): Insert, update, and delete data.<br>
TCL (Transaction Control Language): Manage transactions using COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.<br>
SQL Constraints: Enforce data integrity with primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and more.<br>
Views: Create virtual tables based on the result-set of an SQL statement.<br>
Aggregate Functions: Calculate statistical values like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.<br>
Operators: Use arithmetic, comparison, logical, and string operators to manipulate data.<br>
Stored Procedures and Functions: Create reusable code blocks to automate tasks.<br>
Joins: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.etc<br>
Feel free to explore the scripts, experiment, and learn at your own pace.
