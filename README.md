# MySQL-Learning

Welcome to my Anish-MySQL Learning Repository!
<br>
Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts covering fundamental to advanced MySQL concepts. I'm using XAMPP to set up a local MySQL environment, making it easy for you to follow along.

What you'll learn:

DDL (Data Definition Language): Create, modify, and delete database structures.
DQL (Data Query Language): Retrieve data from databases using SELECT statements.
DML (Data Manipulation Language): Insert, update, and delete data.
TCL (Transaction Control Language): Manage transactions using COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT.
SQL Constraints: Enforce data integrity with primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and more.
Views: Create virtual tables based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
Aggregate Functions: Calculate statistical values like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.
Operators: Use arithmetic, comparison, logical, and string operators to manipulate data.
Stored Procedures and Functions: Create reusable code blocks to automate tasks.
Joins: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.etc
Feel free to explore the scripts, experiment, and learn at your own pace.
